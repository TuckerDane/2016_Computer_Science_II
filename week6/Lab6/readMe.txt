This program is pretty straight forward as it utilizes a menu interface as requested.

The menu interface is the same that is recommended in the assignment guidelines. The flow is as follows:

1. User selects to work with either a Stack or a Que
2. User selects to either push or pop
3. Input validation occurs for an integer to push if push is selected
4. Empty stack/que validation occurs if pop is selected
5. The menu returns to have the user select between push/pop for the selected structure (stack or que)
6. The user also has the option to return to the menu allowing a choice between stack/que. If this happens, the current structure will be deleted
7. Finally, the user has the option to exit and end the program.
